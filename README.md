Summary

Data Source

To kick off the project, I began by procuring the monthly CSV files spanning from January 2020 to June 2020, which were available on the Citi Bike Data webpage. These files were then meticulously arranged and stored within a specific folder that I named "data."

Following this, I initiated the creation of a Jupyter Notebook file labeled "NY_Citi_Bike_Challenge_6m.ipynb." The primary objective of this notebook was to systematically carry out the tasks of cleaning and merging all the individual monthly CSV files into a unified CSV file. This consolidated file was to be prepared for subsequent importation into Tableau.

User Dashboard

An analysis of the data pertaining to the first half of 2020 in New York City reveals some intriguing trends in bicycle usage. During this time period, there was a notable total of 7,508,808 trips made via bicycles. These trips can be categorised into two distinct user types: subscribers and customers, with subscribers accounting for a substantial majority at 79%, while customers comprise the remaining 21% of the total trips.

The data also unveils that June emerges as the most favored month for bicycle travel, with over 1.8 million trips recorded during this period. When examining travel patterns throughout the week, it is evident that on weekdays, the peak travel times are concentrated between 7-8 am and 5-6 pm. Conversely, on weekends, the preferred time for bicycle trips shifts to the range between 1-5 pm.

A particularly intriguing discovery is that among both male and female cyclists, 33-year-olds are the most active participants in terms of trip frequency. This suggests a common age group preference for bicycle commuting. Notably, the data reveals a gender disparity, as males account for just under 70% of the total number of commuters in New York City, highlighting a significant gender skew in bicycle usage patterns. These findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of bicycle commuting in New York City during the first half of 2020, shedding light on user demographics, preferred times for travel, and the prominence of subscribers in the bicycle-sharing ecosystem.

Maps Dashboard 

The distribution of bike stations for both starting and ending points exhibits a notable concentration in key boroughs, primarily Manhattan, Long Island, and Brooklyn. This concentration underscores the strategic placement of stations in densely populated and highly traversed areas, reflecting a well-planned and effective network catering to urban mobility needs.

Stations Dashboard

During the initial half of 2020, the utilisation of bicycles in New York City amounted to a total of 17,190 bikes, deployed across 973 starting and 995 ending stations. This extensive network facilitated an impressive cumulative distance of 9,212,492 kilometers traveled by these bicycles. Notably, the average trip duration displayed seasonal variations, with June recording the lengthiest average trip duration at 27 minutes, aligning with the pleasant weather conditions conducive to extended outdoor activities, while January exhibited the shortest duration at 13 minutes, reflective of the winter season and associated inclement weather conditions, including snowfall in New York City.

The graphical representation, specifically the heatmap, underlines the prevalence of 12 Ave & W 40 St as the station with the highest number of trips, indicating its significance as a popular embarkation and disembarkation point. Further examination of the data indicates that the time of 5 pm registered the maximum volume of trips throughout the six-month period, with a clear distinction highlighting the afternoon hours as the peak period for bicycle usage, as evidenced by the bar chart.

It is worth noting that the month of June not only displayed the longest average trip duration but also emerged as the most prolific month in terms of total trips taken on each weekday, except for Sundays. In contrast, the month of May displayed the highest number of trips taken on Sundays, reflecting a unique pattern of weekend travel. In contrast, the month of April stood out with the lowest number of trips, warranting a more in-depth analysis to discern the underlying factors contributing to this reduced bicycle usage during that specific month.

This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the patterns of bicycle usage in New York City during the first half of 2020, encompassing factors such as seasonality, popular stations, peak hours, and the intriguing variations in monthly and weekly trip counts, offering a foundation for further investigation and informed decision-making regarding urban transportation and bicycle-sharing initiatives. 


Conclusion

In essence, this Tableau analysis provides a comprehensive perspective on the intricate patterns of Citibike usage within a specific timeframe. Through the utilisation of interactive dashboards and data visualisations, we've successfully unearthed pivotal insights related to user characteristics, daily usage trends, and intriguing behavioral phenomena.

One conspicuous trend of note is the substantial surge in Citibike utilisation during the afternoon hours, notably after 5 o'clock, coinciding with the conclusion of the typical workday. This pronounced upswing in demand substantially exceeds the number of morning trips, signifying a significant disproportion in daily usage patterns, which may be indicative of commuter behavior and leisurely post-work activities.

Furthermore, another noteworthy phenomenon arises from the stark gender imbalance in Citibike users, with males constituting close to 70% of all user types. This gender disparity raises questions and merits further investigation into the underlying factors driving this skew, potentially shedding light on gender-specific preferences or barriers within the bike-sharing ecosystem.

It is our aspiration that this analytical exploration not only enlightens but also catalyses additional research endeavors, encouraging fellow analysts to conduct more in-depth inquiries into the dataset, thereby extending and refining the valuable insights presented herein.
